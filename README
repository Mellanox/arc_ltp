# Linux Test Project for ARC Linux

For details about LTP see README.ltp and http://ltp.sourceforge.net/
For details about ARC processors see http://www.synopsys.com/dw/ipdir.php?ds=arc_770d

Not all tests from LTP suite are applicable to ARC Linux which is an embedded
system based on uClibc and BusyBox. So some of the tests need to be disabled in
order for LTP to build and run succesfully.


## Modifications to Original LTP

### Unbuildable Tests

These tests cannot be build by ARC Linux uClibc Toolchain (as of version 4.4). To disable all of
them at once provide --enable-arc-support flag to ./configure command.

* controllers/cpuset
* security/tomoyo
* syscalls/clock_nanosleep


### Tests with changed parameters

These tests can be run on ARC Linux but require are different from default
paramters because they either take too much time to execute or use values that
are too big for an embedded system.

* math/float_bessel - with default parameters take too much time to finish
* math/float_exp_log - with default parameters take too much time to finish
* math/float_iperb - with default parameters take too much time to finish
* math/float_power - with default parameters take too much time to finish
* math/float_trigo - with default parameters take too much time to finish
